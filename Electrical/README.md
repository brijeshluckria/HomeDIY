- Commonly Used Wire Gauges -
-- 14-gauge (AWG 14):Used for lighting circuits and some outlets on 15-amp circuits. A dime is about the thickness of a 14-gauge wire, according to Mister Sparky Electric. 
-- 12-gauge (AWG 12):Used for 20-amp circuits, common for kitchen and bathroom outlets, workshops, and appliances like dishwashers. A nickel is about the thickness of a 12-gauge wire. 
-- 10-gauge (AWG 10): Used for 30-amp circuits, typically for electric dryers, small electric ovens, and water heaters. 
-- 8-gauge (AWG 8): Used for 40-amp circuits, common for large electric ranges and central air conditioning units. 
-- 6-gauge (AWG 6): Used for 50-amp circuits, including large electric ranges and subpanels. 

- In a North American home, the standard electrical service provides two main voltages: 120 volts and 240 volts. While 240 volts is delivered to the house, it is split to provide the two voltage levels that power your appliances

- For a standard 120V outlet in the US, the maximum current you can safely draw is 15 or 20 amps, depending on the circuit it is connected to. Most household circuits are either 15-amp or 20-amp circuits

- 15-amp circuit: This is the most common type found in bedrooms and other general living areas.
-- Maximum current: 15 amps.
-- mafe continuous current: Following the National Electrical Code's 80% rule for continuous loads, you should not exceed 12 amps.
-- Maximum wattage: 1,800 watts (15A x 120V).

- 20-amp circuit: These are common in kitchens, garages, and bathrooms, where higher-power appliances are often used.
-- Maximum current: 20 amps.
-- Safe continuous current: Using the 80% rule, the maximum continuous load is 16 amps.
-- Maximum wattage: 2,400 watts (20A x 120V)

- How much current a 100 watt bulb will draw from an outlet 
-- A 100-watt bulb connected to a standard 120-volt outlet will draw approximately 0.83 amps of current
-- Power (P) = Voltage (V) Ã— Current (I)
-- Current (I) = Power (P) / Voltage (V) 

- How much maximum current we can draw in a USA home 
-- The maximum current you can draw in a U.S. home depends on the size of the main electrical service, which is almost always either 100 or 200 amps. However, the actual current drawn from a household is typically much lower than this maximum capacity. 
-- 200-amp service: This is the current standard for modern homes and new construction. While a 200-amp service provides a total capacity of 48,000 watts (240V x 200A), the National Electrical Code recommends using only 80% for continuous loads, which is 160 amps.
-- 100-amp service: Many older and smaller homes have a 100-amp electrical service, which provides enough power for basic electrical needs, including an electric range and dryer, but may not support heavy electric heating. 


- Voltage vs Current
-- You receive voltage at home, and your appliances draw current. Think of it this way: the voltage is constant, but the amount of current pulled from it depends on what you have plugged in.

- The water pipe analogy
-- Voltage is like water pressure. It is a measure of the potential energy difference, or the "force" that pushes the electrical charge through a circuit. The voltage is always present at your wall outlets, typically at 120V in the U.S..
-- Current is like the flow rate of the water. It's the actual movement of electrical charge (electrons) and is measured in amperes (amps). Your appliances only draw current when they are turned on and functioning.
-- A household circuit is like a large water pipe. The water pressure (voltage) is always available, but the amount of water flowing through the pipe (current) is determined by how many taps you have turned on. A blender draws more current than a phone charger

# Paver Cleaning & Sealing Steps

## 🧹 Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Test only a small area**  
   Perfect start. This lets you confirm the cleaner won’t discolor or etch your pavers.  

2. **Wet the pavers lightly before applying cleaner**  
   This prevents the cleaner from soaking in too fast. Good call.  

3. **Spray with *Simple Green Oxy Solve***  
   Apply evenly. Don’t over-saturate; just enough to cover.  

4. **Let sit ~10 minutes, keeping it wet**  
   Yes — just don’t let it dry on the surface. If it starts to dry, mist with a little water to keep active.  

5. **Pressure wash thoroughly**  
   Use a fan tip (25° or 40° nozzle) and keep at least 8–12" away to avoid damaging the paver surface or washing out too much sand.  

6. **Let it fully dry (48 hrs)**  
   Absolutely right. Both the pavers *and* the joints need to be bone dry before you add polymeric sand.  

7. **Sweep in polymeric sand**  
   Spread dry sand over the surface and sweep into joints until full.  

8. **Compact the pavers**  
   Essential step 👍. The vibration packs the sand deep into the joints.  

9. **Sweep in more polymeric sand**  
   Correct. After compacting, you’ll see joints settle — refill and sweep again.  

10. **Blow off excess sand**  
   Very important. Any sand left on the surface will harden into a haze when watered. Use a leaf blower at a shallow angle.  

11. **Mist with water to activate polymeric sand**  
   Perfect. Mist in light passes; don’t flood, or the binder will wash out. Usually 2–3 gentle sprays over 10–15 minutes is best.  

12. **Optional: Seal once fully dry**  
   Spot on. Wait at least 24–48 hrs (sometimes longer depending on sealer instructions) after the polymeric sand cures.  
   - *Foundation Armor Clear Low Gloss Acrylic Satin* is a good choice if you want slight enhancement and protection, but note: that’s a **film-forming sealer**, so it will change the look a bit (not invisible, but a satin/low-gloss).  
   - If you truly want *invisible*, you’d want **Armor SX5000WB (penetrating, no shine)** instead.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Not drying fully** → both before sanding and before sealing. Moisture trapped = hazing, white spots.  
- **Over-watering polymeric sand** → causes washout or weak joints. Mist gently.  
- **Skipping compaction** → results in shallow sand fill, weak joints, and early weed growth.  
- **Not blowing off dust** → leaves a sticky haze when you add water.

✅ So yes — your steps are good. Just decide whether you want:  
- **Satin / low-gloss enhancement** → *Armor AR350/AR500 or Behr Wet Look* type sealers.  
- **Truly invisible protection** → *Armor SX5000WB* or *Ghostshield Siloxa-Tek 8500*.

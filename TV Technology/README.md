# 📺 TV Technology Timeline – From Old to New

## 1950s – Early 2000s
### **CRT (Cathode Ray Tube)**
- **How it works**: Electron beams excite phosphors on a glass tube screen.  
- **Benefits**: Durable, good color for the time, fast motion response.  
- **Limitations**: Bulky & heavy, small screen sizes, low resolution (SD).  

---

## 1980s – Early 2000s
### **Rear Projection TV (RPTV)**
- **How it works**: Projects image from inside unit onto large screen.  
- **Benefits**: Large screens before flat panels existed, cheaper per inch.  
- **Limitations**: Poor brightness, narrow viewing angles, bulky.  

---

## Late 1990s – Early 2010s
### **Plasma**
- **How it works**: Gas-filled cells emit light when charged.  
- **Benefits**: Deep blacks, good contrast, smooth motion.  
- **Limitations**: Heavy, high power use, screen burn-in, dim in bright rooms.  

---

## Early 2000s – 2010
### **LCD (CCFL-backlit)**
- **How it works**: Liquid crystals modulate light from CCFL (fluorescent) backlight.  
- **Benefits**: Slimmer than plasma/CRT, higher resolution (HD).  
- **Limitations**: Limited contrast, poor black levels, narrow viewing angles.  

---

## 2010 – Today
### **LED-LCD**
- **How it works**: LCD panels with LED backlighting.  
- **Benefits**: Slim, energy-efficient, brighter than CCFL LCD.  
- **Limitations**: Still limited black levels (backlight bleed), weaker viewing angles.  

---

## Mid-2010s – Today
### **QLED (Quantum Dot LED-LCD)**
- **How it works**: LCD with quantum dot filter + LED backlight.  
- **Benefits**: Very bright, vibrant colors, long lifespan, good for bright rooms.  
- **Limitations**: Still LCD-based, so no true blacks.  

---

## Mid-2010s – Today
### **OLED**
- **How it works**: Organic compounds emit light per pixel (self-emissive).  
- **Benefits**: Perfect blacks, infinite contrast, thin design, wide angles, great for movies/gaming.  
- **Limitations**: More expensive, risk of burn-in, lower peak brightness.  

---

## 2020s – Today
### **Mini-LED**
- **How it works**: Uses thousands of tiny LEDs for finer backlight control.  
- **Benefits**: Brighter than OLED, improved contrast vs regular LED, good HDR.  
- **Limitations**: Not per-pixel control, blooming possible.  

---

## 2022 – Today
### **QD-OLED (Quantum Dot OLED)**
- **How it works**: OLED panel with quantum dot layer for enhanced brightness/colors.  
- **Benefits**: Combines OLED’s blacks with QLED’s brightness and vivid color.  
- **Limitations**: Still pricey, newer tech (fewer options yet).  

---

## Emerging (2020s+)
### **MicroLED**
- **How it works**: Each pixel is a microscopic LED (self-emissive like OLED but inorganic).  
- **Benefits**: Combines OLED’s blacks with QLED’s brightness & durability, no burn-in.  
- **Limitations**: Extremely expensive, limited availability.  

---

✅ **Trend:**  
- TVs evolved from bulky/low-res (**CRT**) → bigger but flawed (**Rear Projection, Plasma**) → slim & higher res (**LCD, LED-LCD**) → bright & colorful (**QLED, Mini-LED**) → cinematic blacks (**OLED, QD-OLED**) → and now toward **MicroLED**, which promises the *best of both worlds*.  


# Which one should you pick?

- Dark rooms / movies & cinema feel → OLED is best.
- Bright rooms / sports & gaming → QLED or Mini-LED.
Future luxury tech → MicroLED (if price isn’t an issue).

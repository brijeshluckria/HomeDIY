# 🌿 Sprinkler System Winterization Guide (for PVB Setup)

## ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Turn off the main water supply to the sprinkler system**

   * In your **basement or utility area**, find the irrigation shutoff valve and turn it **clockwise (OFF)**.
   * This stops new water from entering the outdoor system.

2. **Open the bleeder (drain) screw next to the main water supply**

   * This lets water trapped between the indoor shutoff and the backflow preventer drain out.
   * Keep a **towel or small bucket** handy to catch water.
   * Leave it open for a minute, then close it once dripping stops.

3. **Go outside to the backflow preventer (the brass assembly)**

   * This is where you’ll release pressure and drain the above-ground section.

4. **Open both test cocks (small flathead bleeder screws)**

   * Turn each screw **¼ turn** so the slot is **horizontal**.
   * Let all the water drain out completely.
   * You can lightly tap the body or gently shake the pipe if water is trapped.

5. **Turn both blue-handled shutoff valves to a 45° angle**

   * This prevents water from being trapped and allows air expansion.
   * Both valves should be halfway between open and closed.

6. **Turn on the sprinkler system (from your controller)**

   * Run **each zone for about 1 minute**.
   * This uses air suction to pull a little water out of the underground lines (helpful even without a compressor).
   * Don’t worry if sprinklers sputter or no water sprays — that’s normal.

7. **Open the bleeder screws from all 10 zones (if your valves have them)**

   * These are usually small drain caps in the underground valve boxes.
   * Open each one and let any water drip out until dry.
   * If there’s no bleeder screw, don’t worry — the 1-minute run cycle likely relieved the pressure.

8. **Turn off the sprinkler controller completely**

   * Set it to **"Off"**, **"Rain Mode"**, or **"Winter"** so it won’t run automatically.

9. **Insulate the backflow preventer**

   * Wrap it with an **insulated cover**, towel + plastic bag, or foam sleeve.
   * Make sure the openings face downward so any moisture can drain.

## 💡 Optional Tip

If you want to be extra safe:

* After step 2, **slightly open** the indoor shutoff drain again for a few seconds after completing all outdoor steps.
  This confirms everything downstream has drained and no water remains trapped.

# 💧 Backflow Preventer Bleeder Screw Instructions

## ✅ After Draining — What to Do with Bleeder Screws (Test Cocks)

* **Leave the bleeder screws (test cocks) open** — about **¼ turn** open (horizontal).
* Do **not** close them tightly.

### 💡 Why

* Leaving them open prevents **residual water** from getting trapped inside the brass body.
* Even a small amount of trapped water can **freeze and crack** the PVB.
* Keeping them open also allows **air to expand and contract** safely as temperatures fluctuate.

## 🔧 Summary for Valves and Screws

| Component                             | Position During Winter                  | Reason                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Indoor shutoff valve**              | **Closed (Off)**                        | Stops water entering the system         |
| **Indoor bleeder screw**              | **Open until drained**, then **closed** | Drains line, then prevents indoor leaks |
| **PVB test cocks (bleeder screws)**   | **¼ turn open (horizontal)**            | Allows air in, prevents freezing        |
| **PVB shutoff handles (blue levers)** | **45° halfway open**                    | Prevents trapped water                  |
| **Zone bleeders**                     | **Open**                                | Drains underground valves               |

## ✅ Quick Summary

```text
- Indoor bleeder screw → close after draining.
- Outdoor test cocks (on PVB) → leave ¼ turn open.
- Blue-handled valves → set to 45°.
- Zone bleeders → leave open.
```

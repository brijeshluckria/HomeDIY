- Use an HDMI-to-USB-C adapter to connect the projector to the MacBook Air.  
- Whatever plays on the MacBook will display on the projector, and the sound will come through the MacBook Air’s speakers.

## Option 3 — Use an AV Receiver (Best for Flexibility)

- Connect all video sources (MacBook, Fire TV, Blu-ray player, gaming console, etc.) to the **AV receiver** via HDMI.  
- Connect the **HDMI output** from the AV receiver to the projector.  
- The AV receiver will process audio and send it to connected speakers or a soundbar.  
- This setup provides:
  - **High-quality sound** (supports surround sound formats like Dolby Atmos/DTS).  
  - **Easy source switching** (switch between MacBook, Fire TV, console, etc. from the receiver).  
  - **Single connection** to the projector, reducing cable clutter.

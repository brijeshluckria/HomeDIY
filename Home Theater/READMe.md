# Building Blocks of a Home Theater
## 1. Source (where the movie/show comes from)
- Examples: Apple TV, Blu-ray player, PlayStation, Roku, cable box.
- Job: Provides the audio + video signal.

## 2. AV Receiver (the brain + amplifier)
- Job: Takes the signal from the source.
- Splits it into two paths:
    - Video → sends through HDMI to your TV/projector.
    - Audio → amplifies (receiver boosts the weak audio signal into strong electrical power) and sends to your speakers.
- Extra jobs:
    - Lets you switch between sources (one hub).
    - Syncs sound + picture so they match.
    - Decodes formats (Dolby Digital, Atmos, DTS)

## 3. Video Output (the screen)
- Could be a projector + screen (like you have) or a TV.
- Just shows the picture, nothing else.

## Speakers
- Convert the amplified signal into sound.
- Different speakers handle different parts of the sound:
- Front Left/Right → music, effects.
- Center → dialogue.
- Surrounds → background/action sounds.
- Subwoofer → deep bass (explosions, rumbles).


# How the Flow Works

- You start a movie on Apple TV (source).
- The Apple TV sends audio + video → AV receiver.
- The receiver separates them:
    - Video → projector.
    - Audio → speakers & subwoofer.
- The projector shows the movie, the speakers create immersive surround sound.
- You sit in the “sweet spot” and it feels like the theater.

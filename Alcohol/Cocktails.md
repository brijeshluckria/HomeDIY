# 🥃 **Old Fashioned (Classic Recipe)**

**Ingredients:**

* **2 oz (60 ml) bourbon or rye whiskey**
* **¼ oz (7 ml) simple syrup** *(or 1 sugar cube + a few drops of water)*
* **2 dashes Angostura bitters**
* **1 large ice cube** (or a few smaller ones)
* **Orange peel**, for garnish
* *(optional: a cherry, but purists skip it)*

---

**Instructions:**

1. **Add bitters and syrup (or sugar cube)** to a rocks glass.

   * If using a sugar cube, add a few drops of water and **muddle until dissolved**.
2. **Add the whiskey** and stir gently to combine.
3. **Add ice** — ideally one large cube to keep it cold without much dilution.
4. **Express the orange peel** over the drink (twist it over the glass to release oils), then drop it in.
5. *(Optional)* Garnish with a cherry if you like a touch of sweetness.

---

### 💡 **Pro Tips**

* **Bourbon** makes it sweeter and rounder; **rye** gives it a spicier kick.
* Swap the simple syrup for **maple syrup** or **honey syrup** for a unique twist.
* Try a **dash of orange bitters** along with Angostura for extra depth.

Absolutely — here’s a **classic Mojito** done in the same clean, bartender-style format as the others. It’s crisp, refreshing, and easy to make 🍃

---

# 🍃 **Classic Mojito**

**Ingredients:**

* **2 oz (60 ml) white rum**
* **¾ oz (22 ml) simple syrup** *(or 2 tsp sugar + splash of club soda to help it dissolve)*
* **1 oz (30 ml) fresh lime juice** *(about ½ lime)*
* **6–8 fresh mint leaves**, plus a sprig for garnish
* **Club soda**, to top
* **Ice** (preferably crushed or cracked)
* **Lime wedge**, for garnish

---

**Instructions:**

1. **Muddle the mint:**
   In a sturdy glass, add the mint leaves, simple syrup (or sugar), and lime juice.
   Gently **muddle** (press, don’t tear) to release the mint oils without shredding the leaves.

2. **Add rum:**
   Pour in the white rum and give it a gentle stir to combine.

3. **Add ice:**
   Fill the glass with **crushed or cracked ice**.

4. **Top with soda:**
   Add **club soda** to fill the glass, then stir lightly from the bottom to mix.

5. **Garnish:**
   Slap a **mint sprig** between your hands to release aroma and place it on top.
   Add a **lime wedge** if you like.

---

### 💡 **Pro Tips**

* Use **fresh mint (spearmint or mojito mint)** — it’s key to the flavor.
* Don’t over-muddle — bitterness comes from torn mint leaves.
* For a twist: use **flavored syrups** (like mango, strawberry, or coconut) instead of plain simple syrup.

Absolutely — here’s a **classic Martini** written in the same clean, step-by-step format as the others. It’s simple, elegant, and all about balance 🍸

---

# 🍸 **Classic Martini**

**Ingredients:**

* **2 ½ oz (75 ml) gin** *(or vodka, if you prefer a Vodka Martini)*
* **½ oz (15 ml) dry vermouth**
* **Ice**
* **Lemon twist** or **green olive**, for garnish

---

**Instructions:**

1. **Chill the glass:**
   Place a **martini or coupe glass** in the freezer for a few minutes (or fill it with ice water while you mix).

2. **Combine ingredients:**
   Add **gin** (or vodka) and **dry vermouth** to a **mixing glass** filled with ice.

3. **Stir (or shake):**

   * **Stir** gently for **20–30 seconds** until well-chilled and slightly diluted — this is the traditional way.
   * *(If you prefer a “shaken, not stirred” style, shake vigorously for 10 seconds and fine strain.)*

4. **Strain:**
   Strain into your **chilled glass**.

5. **Garnish:**

   * Express a **lemon twist** over the surface and drop it in,
   * **or** garnish with **one or three green olives** (never two — a superstition from bartenders).

---

### 💡 **Pro Tips**

* For a **drier Martini**, use less vermouth (¼ oz or just rinse the glass).
* For a **wetter Martini**, add more vermouth (¾–1 oz).
* Try an **orange bitters dash** for a vintage touch.
* Always use **fresh vermouth** — once opened, store it in the fridge.

Excellent choice — the **Negroni** is one of the most iconic and perfectly balanced cocktails ever made. Here’s the recipe written in the same clear, bartender-style format as the others 🍊

---

# 🍊 **Classic Negroni**

**Ingredients:**

* **1 oz (30 ml) gin**
* **1 oz (30 ml) Campari**
* **1 oz (30 ml) sweet vermouth**
* **Ice**
* **Orange peel**, for garnish

---

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare your glass:**
   Use an **Old Fashioned or rocks glass**. If you like, chill it beforehand for a few minutes.

2. **Combine ingredients:**
   Add **gin**, **Campari**, and **sweet vermouth** directly to the glass (or to a mixing glass, if you prefer it extra smooth).

3. **Add ice:**
   Fill the glass with **large ice cubes** — the bigger, the better for slow dilution.

4. **Stir:**
   Stir gently for **15–20 seconds** to chill and slightly dilute the drink.

5. **Garnish:**
   Express an **orange peel** over the drink (twist it over the glass to release oils), then drop it in.

---

### 💡 **Pro Tips**

* Equal parts make it easy — but you can **reduce Campari slightly** (¾ oz) if you want less bitterness.
* Use a **good-quality gin** with bold botanicals — it needs to stand up to the Campari.
* For a smoother, lighter version, try a **Boulevardier** (swap gin for bourbon).
* If you prefer it chilled but not over ice, **stir with ice in a mixing glass** and **strain into a chilled coupe** — this is called a **Negroni Up**.
